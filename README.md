### What is JLNDragEffectManager?

JLNDragEffectManager is a subclass of NSWindowController which allows you to 
replace a static dragging image with an animated effect similar to dragging 
items from the Library palette to a window or view in Interface Builder.


### What platforms does it support?

Original: It might work on 10.4 (I think), but it should definitely work on
10.5 and beyond.

HH fork: It might work on 10.10 (I think), but it should definitely work on 
10.11 and beyond


### What are the licensing requirements?

See the license document (License.txt) that is included with the source code. It 
is free to use but requires attribution. 
Feel free to contact me at joshua@nozzi.name with any licensing questions.


### How do I use it in my project?

1. Copy JLNDragEffectManager.m and JLNDragEffectManager.h into your project.
2. Include JLNDragEffectManager.h wherever you intend to use it.
3. Link against QuartzCore.framework in any target in which you intend to use 
   it.
4. Wire it up to your desired views' dragging source protocol methods (start to 
   start, moved to update, end to end), per the example code found in 
   DragQueenDemoView.m.


### How can I reach you?

You can e-mail me at joshua@nozzi.name. I'm happy to answer most questions about
this source code but am not willing to "hold your hand" or debug your code. 
It's straightforward to use if you are familiar with Cocoa and take a few 
moments to study the source. Please do your homework first. 
Questions sent to me that make it obvious the sender didn't do their homework 
will be ignored.
