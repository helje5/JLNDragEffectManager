    Here, we start the dragging session normally for the most part. 
    
    Two caveats:
    
    1 - Passing nil for the drag image makes Cocoa angry. You DO NOT want 
        to anger Cocoa the Drag Queen. She's fierce, girl. Seriously. Cocoa
        is also a size queen. An image of NSZeroSize just won't do, honey.
        
        To get around these issues, just give her what she wants: "an" image 
        with dimensions. An empty one with a size of {1, 1} will fool her 
        since she's always liquered up anyway. She'll never notice.

    2 - Cocoa runs on her schedule. If you ask HER to do the slide-back, 
        she'll take her time before we get to clean up after her. Best
        not to ask - we'll do it ourselves.
